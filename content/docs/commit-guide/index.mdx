## Commit & Branching Guide

Welcome to our guide on clean commits and branching! This documentation will
help standardize how we commit changes and manage branches, ensuring a clear,
consistent, and maintainable version control workflow.

## Why Do We Need This?

- <b>Readability</b> : Clear commit messages make it easier to track changes.
- <b>Collaboration</b> : A consistent style helps team members understand changes
  quickly.
- <b>Maintenance</b> : Well-structured branches and commits simplify debugging and
  rollbacks.

## Branching Strategy

We follow GitFlow-inspired branching:

- **main** Production-ready
  code(protected)

- **develop** Integration branch for features (latest devstate)

- <b>feat/</b> Feature branches (e.g., feat/user-profile)

- <b>fix/</b> Hotfix/bugfix branches (e.g., fix/login-error)

### Branch Naming

- Use lowercase and hyphens (-).

- Prefix with feat/, fix/, docs/, etc.

- Example: feat/dark-mode, fix/api-timeout

## Commit changes

<b>Step 1: </b> before you do commit please pay attention where your current branch
you're
<b> Step 2: </b> Please check update change on the current branch.

```bash
git pull
```

<b>Step 3: </b> If you Developing new feature or updated please create new branch
from the current branch.

New feature :

```bash
git checkout -b feat/[name feature]
```

Update feature :

```bash
git checkout -b update/[name feature or else being updated]
```

Fix Bug or error:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/[name feature bug or error]
```

<b>Step 4: </b> Add your change to stagging.{" "}

```bash
git add . || git add [name file or directory has change]
```

<b>Step 5: </b> Commit message need to be clear what change you do in development.
if you're commit new feature use "Feat : what you do".

```bash
git commit -m "Feat : message" || git commit -m "Update : message" || git commit -m "Fix bug : message"
```

<b>Step 6: </b> Push your changes

```bash
git push -u origin [your branch]
```
